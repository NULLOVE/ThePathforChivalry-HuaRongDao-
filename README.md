# ThePathforChivalry-HuaRongDao-
The Path for Chivalry（HuaRongDao）is a game of ancient China.Try to move the knights to let the big boss(CaoCao) run away .
I completed this Game by Jave, clicking the Buttons to moving it one by one,try to let the CaoCao(曹操） run to bottom line,then be successful!
Click the Buttons,the the program judges Buttons how to move.When it have one more directions,It chooses one randomly. My Puzzling is how to do that "To Drag Button to move it"!
Welcom the Master-hands to help writting this Module to achieve it.
