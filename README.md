# ThePathforChivalry-HuaRongDao-
The Path for Chivalry（HuaRongDao）is a game of ancient China.Try to move the knights to let the big boss(CaoCao) run away .
I completed this Game by Java, clicking the Buttons to moving it one by one,try to move the CaoCao(曹操）,when it arrived the bottoms line,then be successful!
Click the Buttons,the the program judges Buttons how to move.When it has one more than directions,It chooses one randomly. My Puzzling is how to do that "To Dragging Buttons to move it"!
Welcom the Master-hands to help me writting this function.
